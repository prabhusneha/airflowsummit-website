We are looking for inspiring talks, innovative use cases, and everything related to Apache Airflow. If you have an idea that can contribute to the community, now is the time to submit it! 


This year, weâ€™re introducing a two-round submission process to support our global community and to give more time to the Airflow 3.0 launch. 

ðŸ”¹ First-round: From January 29 to March 22, submitters will be informed of results by April 8.  This early selection will allow global speakers who need extra time to plan their trip, especially if they require a visa. 

ðŸ”¹ Second-round: From April 15 to May 31st, submitters will be informed of results by June 24. This second round provides additional time, especially for the community members who are currently focused on the launch of Airflow 3.0, 

ðŸ’¡ Note: If your proposal is not selected in the first round, you are invited to resubmit in the second round. All submissions will be reviewed again and compared to new entries.
